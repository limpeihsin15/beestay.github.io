            <h4 id="ewaste">B. Electronic Waste</h4>
            <p>To the unbeknowst of many, electronic waste could be recycled. By recycling the waste, many virgin resources and energy could be saved.<br>Not only you save materials by recycling these old electronics, but you can get special rebates as there are many popular tech companies which provide special deals for those who trade in old electronics at their stores.<br>*<b>DISCLAIMER</b>* Batteries should be removed and recycled separately from the electronic waste as they are toxic and could melt, resulting in a high chance of an explosion.</p>
            <h4 id="foodwaste">C. Food Waste</h4>
            <p>Food waste often contains chemicals, liquids or organic materiel which is unable to be properly recycled into an item like processed items. However food waste could still be used for many uses. One of them is to be used as compost materiel.<br>Compost is a good alternative to chemical fertilizers so for all you Green Thumbs out there, note this down and get ready to grow the personal garden of your dreams! (If you could handle the smell)</p>
        <h2 id="facility">2. Contact Or Visit Recycling Facilities Near You</h2>
